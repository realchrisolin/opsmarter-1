OpSmarter 5.0
=============

This script was written to generate convenient links and visual elements to Salesforce.com for the Blackboard Support program. It's currently housed here as a media back-up and for educational purposes as it demonstrates a xmlhttpRequest() which parses AJAX from a remote site, identifies certain aspects of a case, and creates new styles, buttons, and links via the DOM.

Currently universities and educational institutions are hard-coded; it's public knowledge that these organizations use the Blackboard Learn product. A future goal is to pull these client lists from another remote site where they could be stored as a wiki.

Note: Certain elements of the script refer to HTML objects that are not public and would need to be replaced to suit your purposes. The release of this script is intended to be a tutorial and demonstration of some of the cool things JavaScript can do.
